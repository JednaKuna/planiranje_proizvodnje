# Wagner-Whiting production planning (still in progress)

This is an app for calculating optimal production cycle using Wagner-Whitin method with fixed and variable demands.

My goal for this project was to get familiar with web development.

My stack of choice for this projet: JavaScript and Python(Flask)

# Usage

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

# Installation

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

1. Install Python (preferably, version >= 3.11)
2. Install Flask

# How it works

First we need to specify the time period(usually in months). Then we press "Add fields" button that generates input fields for each month.
After that, we can add the rest of the inputs and press "Submit" button to get the calculation results.

# What I learned

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

1. Before writing any code, it is important to figure out bussines logic, basic front end elements and I/O logic. That way we can build elements that are easier to combine together and work more efficient.

2. It helps to start with sudo code. That way I can see what functions to make and how to combine them

3. Separate different parts of the code. Code separation makes it easier to make changes, add new features and debug the code.

4. Implement one feature at the time. It makes debugging much easier and faster.

5. Test the code
